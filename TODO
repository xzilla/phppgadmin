Principles
----------

* register_globals off support
* maximum error_reporting support - enforces code quality, reduces bugs and 
  improves security
* PHP 5.0 features used
* No HTML font, colour, layout tags.  Use CSS for everything
* One day we should make it all XHTML
* everything properly escaped - prevent sql injection and cross-site scripting 
  probs
* Support Postgres 7.3 and upwards
* psql -E is a cool way of seeing how to do schema queries
* Checking out older versions of describe.c in src/bin/psql in the postgres 
  distro is a good way of seeing how to query older versions of postgres for 
  schema information
* Put functions in the highest class possible.  For instance, simple selects 
  should be in Postgres, whereas something that works for 7.1+ should be in the 
  7.1 class.  This will minimise bugs and duplicated code.
* Adhere to current coding standards
* Avoid using global variables if possible
