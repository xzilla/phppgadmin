phpPgAdmin History
------------------

Version 4.0.1

Bugs

* Fix issue with includes where '.' is not in the include_path
* Don't prompt to share credentials when only one server is present
* Fix logout link
* Preserve expanded/collapsed across result pages

  pg_clientencoding() itself doesn't exist, then force setting the encoding
