HowTo run the tests follow these steps :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create & configure your ./tests/selenium/config.test.php (See sample one in ./tests/selenium/config.inc.php-dist).
2. Run the ./build_tests.php script
	This script builds the TestSuite.html file and all the related html tests files in ./tests/selenium/static/.
	It builds one directory for each server selected to run the tests in your ./tests/selenium/config.inc.php
	and creates the static selenium html test files for each of them.
3. Open your browser and go to http://$webUrl/
	Where $webUrl is the value set in your ./tests/selenium/config.inc.php
4. Click on "Selenium tests" on the PPA intro page & run the tests using the "Selenium TestRunner" buttons in the top-right frame.

Enjoy the tests.


HowTo write new tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The selenium's HTML tests files cannot behave differently in regard to the PG backend where the tests are run on. In order to address
this issue we are using "test-builder" scripts to create these static HTML files. These scripts are connected to each backends using
the PPA database classes and allow you to use their methods, and especialy the $data->has*() ones,  throught the $data variable like 
in any other ppa script.

1. how build_tests is working and why
The build_tests.php script is processing the test-builders scripts from ./tests/selenium/src in alphanumeric order. That's why each
test-builder's name should follow these rules: begin with 2numeric number, then -, then the script name (ex. 01-test1.php or 46-test46.php).

It allows to enforce the order the scripts will be run during the testSuite. This way, column's tests could be run *after* the table's tests
in the test suite and use the previous created tables.

2. how test-builder are working

These scripts are included and executed in the build_tests.php in alphanumeric order.
They should:
- begin with the declaration of the global values $testsuite_file and $test_static_dir which holds the paths to the TestSuite file
and the static folder where the HTML tests files are created
- create a "TestBuilder" intance which gonna helps write HTML tests quickly. 
	The constructor takes the following arguments:
	- server's label (from your config.inc.php)
	- HTML title of the page
	- Test description (appears on top of the tests table)

	$t = new TestBuilder($server['desc'],
		'Index tests',
		'Create/Drop an unique Index'
	);

- once the TestBuilder instance is created, you can use it to write our tests.
	In particular, you should use the login($username, $pass) and logout() methods.
	Each selenium actions are mapped (or should be) as methods. As instance, if you want to use the clickAndWait action, you should call the
	 clickAndWait($locator) method. For the assertText, assertText($selector, $value), etc...

- finish whith calling the TestBuilder's "writeTests" method which will create the selenium HTML test file in the static dir and append this
new test file to the testSuite file.

	$t->writeTests("{$test_static_dir}/{$server['desc']}/view.html", $testsuite_file);
